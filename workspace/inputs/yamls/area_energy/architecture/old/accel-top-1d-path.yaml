      # Unfortunately, default plug-ins only support 45nm (for the components we need to use)
      technology: "45nm"

  # The other stuff (DRAM, buffer) is in the 2d-path architecture file

  #### We need a PE array AND we need a staging buffer AND we need a 2D mesh
  # this file only contains the 1D PE array and the staging buffer 
  # Oy, we need a row of PEs and a staging buffer
